    This broker runs a background thread to fetch action chunks from the policy

    - Asynchronous action fetching
    - Latency tracking (basic)
    - Action queue management (merging/replacing based on delay)

    Args:
        policy: The underlying policy (e.g., WebsocketClientPolicy).
        frequency_hz: The control frequency in Hz.
        action_queue_size_to_get_new_actions: Threshold to request new actions.
        rtc_enabled: Whether to enable RTC mode (replace queue) or append mode.

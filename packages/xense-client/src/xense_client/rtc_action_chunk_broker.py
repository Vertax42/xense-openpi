class RTCActionChunkBroker(_base_policy.BasePolicy):
    """Wraps a policy to return actions using an RTC-style ActionQueue.

    This broker runs a background thread to fetch action chunks from the policy
    and maintains a thread-safe queue of actions. It handles:
    - Asynchronous action fetching
    - Latency tracking (basic)
    - Action queue management (merging/replacing based on delay)

    Delay estimation strategy (important for smoothness):
        The model freezes the FIRST ``inference_delay`` actions of the newly
        generated chunk as a copy of ``prev_chunk_left_over`` (the frozen
        prefix). At merge time the queue truncates at ``real_delay`` (the
        steps actually consumed during inference). For smooth transitions we
        need ``real_delay <= estimated_delay`` so the truncation point falls
        inside the frozen prefix (where new_actions == old_actions byte for
        byte). To achieve this, we take the MAX of the recent real delays
        and add ``delay_margin`` on top, rather than using just the last
        observed delay.

    Args:
        policy: The underlying policy (e.g., WebsocketClientPolicy).
        frequency_hz: The control frequency in Hz.
        action_queue_size_to_get_new_actions: Threshold to request new actions.
        rtc_enabled: Whether to enable RTC mode (replace queue) or append mode.
        execution_horizon: Informational execution horizon forwarded to the
            policy. Not used for queue trigger logic.
        blend_steps: Number of steps to linearly blend old/new actions at the
            merge point. 0 disables blending.
        default_delay: Fallback ``inference_delay`` used during warmup and
            before any real delay has been measured.
        delay_margin: Safety margin added on top of ``max(recent_real_delays)``
            when computing the delay sent to the model. Larger values are
            safer (guarantee real_delay <= estimated_delay) but shrink the
            usable denoised postfix. 2 is a reasonable default for latencies
            that jitter by a couple of control steps.
        delay_history_size: Number of past real delays tracked for the max.
        dry_run: If True, each infer() includes ``rtc_metrics`` (delay, round-trip ms, etc.).
